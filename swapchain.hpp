/**
 * The presentation mode is arguably the most important setting for the swap chain, 
 * because it represents the actual conditions for showing images to the screen. 
 * There are four possible modes available in Vulkan:
 *   VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR: Images submitted by your application are 
 * transferred to the screen right away, which may result in tearing.
 *   VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR: The swap chain is a queue where the display 
 * takes an image from the front of the queue when the display is refreshed 
 * and the program inserts rendered images at the back of the queue. 
 * If the queue is full then the program has to wait. 
 * This is most similar to vertical sync as found in modern games. 
 * The moment that the display is refreshed is known as "vertical blank".
 *   VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR: This mode only differs from the previous
 *  one if the application is late and the queue was empty at the last vertical blank. 
 * Instead of waiting for the next vertical blank, the image is transferred right 
 * away when it finally arrives. This may result in visible tearing.
 *   VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR: This is another variation of the second mode. 
 * Instead of blocking the application when the queue is full, the images that 
 * are already queued are simply replaced with the newer ones. 
 * This mode can be used to render frames as fast as possible while still avoiding tearing,
 * resulting in fewer latency issues than standard vertical sync. 
 * This is commonly known as "triple buffering", although the existence of three buffers 
 * alone does not necessarily mean that the framerate is unlocked.

 * Only the VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR mode is guaranteed to be available
 * so we return it if we don't find better
